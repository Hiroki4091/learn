W : Hello.

W : I keep receiving your brochures on house renovations.

W : I’m not interested, and I’d like you to stop sending them to me, please.

W : It’s annoying to have to throw them out every time.

M : I’m sorry about that, madam.

M : There should be an e-mail address on the back page of the brochure.

M : If you write us a short message explaining the problem, we will remove you from our mailing list.

W : I did that three months ago, but I’m still getting them.

W : I’d like this to be dealt with now.

M : I can only apologize again.

M : Please stay on the line — I’ll get the necessary form and fill it out for you.
